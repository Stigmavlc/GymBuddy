### 4. **Smart Negotiation Handling**

## 🚀 How It Works

### Step 1: Partner Pairing
Users can pair with each other through natural language:
```
User: "I want to pair with Youssef"
Bot: "✅ Partner request sent to Youssef! They'll receive a notification and can accept or decline your request. 🤝"
```

### Step 2: Automatic Coordination Trigger
When both partners set availability:
```
User: "Set me available Monday 9am-11am"
Bot: "✅ Got it! Added Monday: 9:00-11:00 to your schedule."
[Automatically checks if partner also has availability]
```

### Step 3: Interactive Session Selection
If coordination is triggered, both partners receive:
```
🏋️‍♂️ WORKOUT COORDINATION 💪

Both Ivan and Youssef have set availability!

Here are optimal 2-hour session suggestions:

Option 1: Monday, 2024-01-15
⏰ 09:00 - 11:00
📍 2-hour gym session

Option 2: Wednesday, 2024-01-17
⏰ 18:00 - 20:00
📍 2-hour gym session

Please select your preferred option. Both partners need to choose the same option to confirm the session! 🤝

[✅ Option 1 (Monday 09:00)] [✅ Option 2 (Wednesday 18:00)] [❌ Need different times]
```

### Step 4: Session Confirmation
When both partners select the same option:
```
🎉 SESSION CONFIRMED! 🎉

👥 Partners: Ivan & Youssef
📅 Date: Monday, 2024-01-15
⏰ Time: 09:00 - 11:00
💪 Duration: 2 hours

🏋️‍♂️ See you at the gym! Let's crush this workout together!
```
