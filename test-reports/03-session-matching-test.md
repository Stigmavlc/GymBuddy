# Session Matching Algorithm Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-07-28

## Test Summary
Testing the session matching algorithm that finds optimal 2-hour workout sessions based on overlapping availability between gym partners.

## Algorithm Overview
1. Fetches availability for both users from database
2. Finds overlapping time slots
3. Generates 2-hour consecutive session options
4. Creates weekly plans with 2 non-consecutive sessions
5. Ranks plans by optimal spacing (prefers ~3 days apart)

## Test Cases

### 1. Overlapping Slot Detection
- **Test**: Find common available times
- **Expected**: Only slots where both users are available
- **Algorithm**:
  - Compares day and hour for exact matches
  - Returns array of overlapping TimeSlots
- **Result**: ⏳ Pending manual test

### 2. Session Option Generation
- **Test**: Create 2-hour workout blocks
- **Expected**: Consecutive 2-hour blocks from overlapping slots
- **Features**:
  - Groups slots by day
  - Finds consecutive hours
  - Creates 2-hour duration sessions
- **Result**: ⏳ Pending manual test

### 3. Weekly Plan Creation
- **Test**: Generate weekly workout plans
- **Expected**: 2 sessions per week, non-consecutive days
- **Rules**:
  - Sessions must be on different days
  - At least 1 day gap between sessions
  - No more than 5 days apart
- **Result**: ⏳ Pending manual test

### 4. Plan Ranking
- **Test**: Optimal plan ordering
- **Expected**: Plans sorted by spacing quality
- **Scoring**:
  - Ideal: 3 days apart (Mon/Thu, Tue/Fri)
  - Scored by deviation from 3-day spacing
  - Returns top 5 plans
- **Result**: ⏳ Pending manual test

### 5. Edge Cases
- **Test**: Handle various scenarios
- **Cases**:
  - No overlapping availability → Empty array
  - Only 1 overlapping slot → No plans
  - All days have overlaps → Multiple plan options
  - Same day overlaps only → No valid plans
- **Result**: ⏳ Pending manual test

### 6. Database Integration
- **Test**: Fetch real user availability
- **Expected**: Correctly parses availability table data
- **Process**:
  - Converts time ranges to individual slots
  - Maintains day index for calculations
- **Result**: ⏳ Pending manual test

## Technical Analysis

### Strengths
- Efficient overlap detection using array methods
- Smart grouping by day for performance
- Flexible ranking system
- Clear separation of concerns

### Potential Issues
- No handling of time zones
- Assumes 2-hour sessions only
- Limited to 5 plan options
- No preference for specific times (morning/evening)

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect Match
- User 1: Mon-Fri 6-8 PM
- User 2: Mon-Fri 5-9 PM
- Expected: Multiple options (Mon/Wed, Mon/Thu, Tue/Thu, etc.)

### Scenario 2: Limited Overlap
- User 1: Mon 6-8 PM, Thu 7-9 PM
- User 2: Mon 7-9 PM, Thu 6-8 PM
- Expected: Mon 7-9 PM + Thu 7-9 PM

### Scenario 3: No Match
- User 1: Weekdays only
- User 2: Weekends only
- Expected: No plans available

## Recommendations
1. Add unit tests for algorithm functions
2. Consider user preferences (morning/evening)
3. Add flexibility for session duration
4. Handle time zone differences
5. Add minimum rest days preference
6. Consider workout intensity spacing
